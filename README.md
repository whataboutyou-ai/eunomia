## Overview

Traditional authorization layers, focused on user-resource separation, become obsolete with AI agents. These agents, both autonomous and controllable, necessitate a new permission paradigm.

The ability for agents to access tools—executable actions beyond static data—and initiate interactions with other agents introduced policy requirements that legacy systems couldn't meet. This duality demands dynamic yet deterministic boundaries that adapt to context, reflecting their role as both actor and resource.

We aim to solve this with Eunomia, an open-source, developer-oriented authorization framework that:

- Makes it possible to consider agents as both actors and resources
- Enforces dynamic yet deterministic policies based on static and contextual attributes
- Enables leaner agent architectures with decoupled authorization logic
- Preserves agent decision-making while enforcing security

## Get Started

Eunomia is a standalone server to decouple the authorization logic from the main architecture of your AI Agent.

### Installation

Install the `eunomia` package via pip:

```bash
pip install eunomia-ai
```

### Running the Server

The server can be served locally with:

```bash
eunomia server
```

### Usage

Check out the [quickstart example][docs-quickstart] in the documentation for a fully working example.

## Eunomia SDKs

Different packages are available in this repository for an easier interaction with the server. These packages make the integration of Eunomia inside your AI application as seamless as possible within your favorite development framework.

The following integrations are currently available:

- [Python](pkgs/sdks/python)
- [LangChain](pkgs/sdks/langchain)
- ...and more coming soon!
