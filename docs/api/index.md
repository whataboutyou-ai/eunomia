This section contains the detailed API documentation for Eunomia.

Eunomia is developed and distributed through multiple libraries:

- The main library contains the Eunomia server and all its logic
- The _core_ library contains shared functionality across all Eunomia libraries
- The _SDKs_ libraries are meant to ease the interaction with the server from different programming languages
- The _extensions_ libraries expand Eunomia's capabilities by integrating with popular frameworks and protocols in the AI ecosystem
