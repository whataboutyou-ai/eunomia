## Code Contribution

### Your development branch

First, [fork][github-fork] the `eunomia` repository and then clone your forked repository locally:

```bash
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/eunomia.git

# SSH
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/eunomia.git
```

Once in the cloned repository directory, make a branch with your username and description of the pull request:

```bash
git checkout -B <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<PR_DESCRIPTION>
```

### Python environment

Install the required dependecies with [uv][uv-home]:

```bash
uv sync
```

If you are developing one of the SDKs, which are built as separate packages, you can install the dependencies for that specific package:

```bash
uv sync --package eunomia-sdk-<NAME>
```

### Testing and formatting

Before pushing your changes, ensure the tests pass and the code style aligns:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format --check
```

_Note: a GitHub workflow will check the tests and formatting and reject the PR if it doesn't pass, so please make sure it passes locally._

## Improving the Documentation

Install the required dependecies with [uv][uv-home] including the documentation dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --group docs --all-packages
```

To build the documentation and serve it locally, run the following command in the repository's root folder; the documentation will update every time you make a change:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

The documentation is built with [Material for MkDocs][material-mkdocs-home], refer to their documentation for more information on how to use it.
