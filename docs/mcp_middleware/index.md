Add **policy-based authorization** to your [Model Context Protocol (MCP)][mcp-docs] servers built with [FastMCP][fastmcp-docs] with one line of code.

!!! tip "Note"

    Eunomia is the [official authorization middleware][fastmcp-eunomia-docs] of FastMCP!

## What is Eunomia MCP Middleware?

With the Eunomia MCP Middleware, you can control which tools, resources and prompts MCP clients can view and execute on your server. Define dynamic JSON-based policies and obtain a comprehensive audit log of all access attempts and violations.

### Key Features

- 🔒 **Policy-Based Authorization**: Control which agents can access which MCP tools, resources, and prompts
- 📊 **Audit Logging**: Track all authorization decisions and violations
- 🔄 **Centralized Policy Enforcement**: Optionally use a remote Eunomia server for centralized policy enforcement
- ⚡ **FastMCP Integration**: One-line middleware integration with FastMCP servers
- 🔧 **Flexible Configuration**: JSON-based policies for complex dynamic rules with CLI tooling

## How It Works

The Eunomia middleware intercepts all MCP requests to your server and automatically maps MCP methods to authorization checks.

### Listing Operations

The middleware behaves as a filter for listing operations (`tools/list`, `resources/list`, `prompts/list`), hiding to the client components that are not authorized by the defined policies.

```mermaid

    participant MCPClient as MCP Client
    participant EunomiaMiddleware as Eunomia Middleware
    participant MCPServer as FastMCP Server
    participant EunomiaServer as Eunomia Server

    MCPClient->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Listing Request (e.g., tools/list)
    EunomiaMiddleware->>MCPServer: MCP Listing Request
    MCPServer-->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Listing Response
    EunomiaMiddleware->>EunomiaServer: Authorization Checks
    EunomiaServer->>EunomiaMiddleware: Authorization Decisions
    EunomiaMiddleware-->>MCPClient: Filtered MCP Listing Response
```

### Execution Operations

The middleware behaves as a firewall for execution operations (`tools/call`, `resources/read`, `prompts/get`), blocking operations that are not authorized by the defined policies.

```mermaid

    participant MCPClient as MCP Client
    participant EunomiaMiddleware as Eunomia Middleware
    participant MCPServer as FastMCP Server
    participant EunomiaServer as Eunomia Server

    MCPClient->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Execution Request (e.g., tools/call)
    EunomiaMiddleware->>EunomiaServer: Authorization Check
    EunomiaServer->>EunomiaMiddleware: Authorization Decision
    EunomiaMiddleware-->>MCPClient: MCP Unauthorized Error (if denied)
    EunomiaMiddleware->>MCPServer: MCP Execution Request (if allowed)
    MCPServer-->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Execution Response (if allowed)
    EunomiaMiddleware-->>MCPClient: MCP Execution Response (if allowed)
```

## Installation
