## Why Eunomia?

As AI-driven applications evolve, the necessity of separating authorization concerns from core logic becomes more apparent. By implementing policy enforcement as a distinct service, developers can ensure that AI Agents operate efficiently while maintaining the flexibility needed to adapt to changing security landscapes.

This library aims to provide a structured approach to **decoupling authorization policies from AI Agent architectures**, enabling developers to focus on agents' performance while ensuring robust and scalable security mechanisms.
