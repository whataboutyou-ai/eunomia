## What is Eunomia?
Eunomia is a Python library that allows you to control which data flows into your Large Language Model-based application.
It is built and maintained by [What About You][whataboutyou-website], while contributions are welcome from the [community](../community/index.md).

## Why Eunomia?

### Data Governance for LLMs
LLMs are only as useful as the knowledge and data they have access to.

At the same time, users need to be able to control which data those LLMs can access, which seems doable at first. However, the more interconnected and integrated a data stack becomes, the more difficult it is to control.

We firmly believe data governance will be one of the biggest blockers to wider AI adoption, and we aim to reduce this barrier through Eunomia.

### A Modular Framework for Data Governance
Eunomia aims to leverage the opportunities presented by the same LLMs and different ML models to address the key challenges of data governance.

Specifically, this framework applies data governance at a token level, thanks to a modular set of instruments, particularly built to address certain issues. These instruments can be combined to accomodate a wide range of use cases.
